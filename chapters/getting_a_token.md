# Getting an Authentication Token

You will require an authentication token when making requests to our web API, and this chapter will help you learn how to
get one for your app/project.

## How the Token system works

Each account has the ability to own ONE authentication token. You are however able to change this token with a simple request
and we will show you how to do that later in this chapter.
